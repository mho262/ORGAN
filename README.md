# Organ

ORGAN is a medical journal app where your medical information can be stored. You are able to record symptoms, medications, appointments and your daily routine.

## Inspiration

We were inspired by the issue of not being able to remember issues you wanted to talk to your doctor about as well as forgetting to tract your medical journey with medication or symptoms. Often times, when we do tract it in some format, it is scattered and hard to locate, which made us think about creating a medical journal to store the information.

## Resources
It is built using Flutter, Visual-Studio, and Android Studio written in Dart.

## Accomplishments
Learn new languages like Dart and in a very short period of time, we try to build our mobile application in android using the Flutter SDK tool. Thank you so much Liam and their team at Perceive!
